"""Migration 3.2.6: install the meta.json + traces/*.md git merge drivers.

Sibling of ``m_3_1_1_event_log_merge_driver.py``. #2709 / FR-003 / FR-004 / C-006:
the squash mission→target integration (``git merge --squash -X theirs``) must
reconcile target-newer ``meta.json`` acceptance/VCS provenance and ``traces/*.md``
sections instead of clobbering them. Custom merge drivers override ``-X theirs``
on their registered paths, so this migration seeds the ``.gitattributes`` mapping
plus the local ``merge.<driver>.*`` config for both drivers.

The seeding body itself lives in ``_merge_driver_seeding.py`` and is shared with
the other driver-seeding migrations (DIRECTIVE_044 — parametrized, not cloned).
