"""Shared, topology-aware ``for_review`` commit gate (FR-011, contract C-7).

The ONE ``in_progress -> for_review`` commit gate, hoisted here as a ``lanes``-side
leaf so every surface -- ``orchestrator-api transition`` and (WP09)
``agent status emit`` -- enforces identical semantics: a lane WP cannot reach
``for_review`` with no implementation commit on its lane branch beyond the base.

**Surface-neutral error contract.** :func:`evaluate_for_review_gate` *returns* a
:class:`GateDecision`; it NEVER raises the orchestrator envelope (``_fail`` /
``NoReturn``). Each caller renders its own failure (envelope JSON on the
orchestrator, a CLI error on ``agent status emit``) from the decision fields.

**Why ``lanes`` and not ``status``.** ``status`` already carries a bidirectional
deferred-import cycle with ``lanes``; this gate needs ``lanes._git`` and
``lanes.worktree_allocator.predict_lane_worktree``, so a ``lanes``-side leaf keeps
it a leaf and avoids hardening that cycle. It imports only sibling ``lanes``
modules plus the lower ``mission_runtime`` / ``core`` layers -- never
``orchestrator_api`` or a ``status`` aggregate.

**Topology-aware, both directions.** The verdict is decided on *commit state*
(``git rev-list <base>..HEAD`` inside the lane worktree), not on a
clone-vs-primary topology guess: a checkout with satisfied commits PASSES and a
checkout with unsatisfied commits FAILS, identically on every surface.
