"""Drift guards for the CI gate-coverage checker (Issue #2034 / #1933).

CI selects tests by ``(paths, -m marker_expr)`` per gate, sharded across jobs.
Tests carrying only authoring markers (``unit`` / ``contract``) or living in a
directory no gate touches are selected by **zero** gates — they never run in CI,
so a regression in them is invisible (a silent coverage hole, not a red).

The static model lives in :mod:`tests.architectural._gate_coverage`. These tests
are its guards:

* **Cheap structural guards** — assert the four suite-running workflows still
  parse into a well-formed gate model and that the *kinds* of selection the
  checker relies on (the core-misc shard matrix, the ``windows_ci`` /
  ``quarantine`` / ``timing`` / ``slow`` selectors) are still present. If CI is
  restructured so the checker can no longer see a selection, these fail loudly
  rather than letting the orphan analysis silently go stale.

* **The orphan ratchet** — recollects the whole suite and fails on any **new**
  ungated file beyond the frozen ``_gate_coverage_baseline.json`` worklist. The
  existing ~9.8k-test backlog is recorded, not fixed here (that re-tiering is the
  maintainer's migration, against this guardrail); only *new* leaks go red.
  Duplicate selections are **reported, not enforced** — fast↔integration overlap
  is intentional.

The ratchet recollects the suite in a subprocess (~90s). It is marked
``architectural`` so it runs in the dedicated shard, not the fast developer loop.

# mission's load-bearing invariant). Every job WP06 re-topologizes must still
# execute the exact same set of tests it did before, enforced against a
# committed pre-change baseline (data-model E3), not just an internal
# partition-consistency claim (GC-1).
#
# Kept in THIS already-arch-sharded, WP02-owned module (rather than a new
# sibling file) so it inherits the arch shard-marker assignment without a
# cross-lane edit to WP01's tests/_arch_shard_map.py — the alternative the T008
# guidance names first ("a new test in test_gate_coverage.py ... or a sibling
# module").
#
# SCOPE + DESIGN: WP06 CHANGES the selected test set for the THREE jobs in
# ``gc.BASELINE_TARGETS`` (see the scope note above it) — integration-tests-next
# (T014 shard matrix), slow-tests (T015 path-narrow), and fast-tests-core-misc
# (T017 shard rebalance, a two-leg job); everything else WP06 touches is
# parallelization-only (adds ``-n auto``, same test set) and is coverage-safe by
# construction. The committed baseline for each target is a REAL native
# ``pytest --collect-only -q`` UNION across its legs
# (:func:`gc.collect_real_union_for_target` / :func:`gc.collect_job_nodeids`,
# which parse pytest's own ``-m``-honouring output — NOT the marker-dump plugin,
# which clears items before ``-m`` deselection and would freeze the UNFILTERED
# set). GC-2b then compares the modeled-current selection
# (:func:`gc._selected_nodeids` = :class:`gc.CompiledGate` over ONE shared
# :func:`gc.collect_universe`) against that REAL baseline: one collection reused
# across all parametrized cases, so this stays fast (a CI-speed mission must not
# add ~10min of per-job ``--collect-only`` fan-out to its own arch shard).
# Because the BASELINE is real and model-independent, GC-2b is itself a fidelity
# check (a mis-parsed ``-m``/path in ``selects()`` would diverge from the real
# baseline and RED); the ``next``-tier spot-check keeps that model==real proof
# LIVE at one subprocess. A comparison that only fault-injects the baseline side
# is a FAKEABLE seam for the producer side (reviewer-renata, MEDIUM); the two
# fault-injection tests below close both halves (baseline-file side AND
# producer/real-selection side).

# files, forcing a ``--freeze-baselines`` refreeze every time nothing actually
# regressed. ``test_gc2b_current_selection_matches_baseline`` below now
# enforces only the LOAD-BEARING orphan-detection signal (a ``dropped``

    """Scoped model-fidelity anchor: modeled ``selects()`` == a FRESH real collect.

    GC-2b's ``current`` side is the model over a shared universe (for speed);
    this keeps a LIVE, independent proof that the model is faithful — that
    ``CompiledGate.selects()`` is not silently mis-modelling a job's ``-m``
    expr or a positional/ignore path while the modeled and real-baseline sides
    happen to agree (reviewer-renata, MEDIUM). It re-derives ONE job's
    selection through a completely independent path at runtime — a real, scoped
    ``pytest --collect-only`` subprocess (:func:`gc.collect_job_nodeids`, which
    parses pytest's own ``-m``-honouring output) — and asserts it equals the
    model over the universe.

    Scoped to the sharded ``next`` tier (not fanned out over all 22 targets):
    the mission's headline re-topologization, and a marker-selected,
    multi-positional command — exactly the shape most at risk of a mis-model —
    so the live proof costs one small collection, not twenty-two (a per-job
    real subprocess for every target would add ~10min to the arch shard, which
    a CI-speed mission must not do).
