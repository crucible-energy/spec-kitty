"""Architectural test: runtime template Governance Payload Contract matches resolver.

The runtime ``implement.md`` and ``review.md`` templates carry a
``## Governance Payload Contract`` section listing the governance surfaces the
prompt is guaranteed to expose. This test pins **template-promise ↔
resolver-reality** consistency: every surface the template promises MUST be
present in :func:`build_charter_context`'s output for a fixture mission whose
WP frontmatter selects an agent profile.

The reverse direction is intentionally NOT enforced — the resolver may emit
additional surfaces (e.g. extra action-doctrine entries) without forcing a
template update.

See `kitty-specs/wp-prompt-governance-payload-01KRR8HS/contracts/`
`runtime-template-governance-payload-contract.md` §7.

FR-010 hardening (#2548 WS3 audit, WP01 of mission
content-address-ratchet-allowlists-01KX8M4D): the promised-surface set below
is DERIVED from the same Python-level constants/formatters
:func:`build_charter_context` itself reads — ``ACTION_CRITICAL_SECTIONS``,
``DEFAULT_AUTHORITY_PATHS``, the ``fetch_stanza`` formatter, and the shipped
``reviewer-renata`` profile's ``directive-references`` — instead of being
re-typed as independent literal strings in this test file. A legitimate
wording edit applied at the source (e.g. renaming a section) therefore stays
green here without a matching test-file edit; only a genuine
promise-vs-reality gap reds.

# Fixture Charter

> Version: 1.0.0

## Purpose

Fixture charter used by the architectural template-contract test. The body
declares both a ``template_set`` and ``available_tools`` so the resolver
emits no fallback diagnostics.

## Terminology Canon

- The canonical term for a unit of governed work is **Mission**.
- Legacy aliases such as ``feature`` and ``features`` are prohibited in
  canonical and operator-facing language.

## Code Review Checklist

- The WP diff respects the agent profile's directive-references.
- Terminology in code and docs aligns with the project glossary
  (DIRECTIVE_032 — Conceptual Alignment).

## Regression Vigilance (2026-04-06)

When renaming identifier-bearing terms, the reviewer MUST grep the diff for
the old term and MUST consult the project glossary at ``docs/context/``.
