"""WP05 — class-closing guards for #2709 (FR-008 / SC-005).

Two NON-VACUOUS architectural lints that close the "merge silently overwrites
target-newer canonical state" defect class *by construction*, covering BOTH loss
mechanisms — NOT a re-run of the WP01 outcome repro. Precedent for the AST /
per-registry lint home: ``tests/architectural/test_merge_pipeline_ratchets.py``.

* **T012 — no-blind-copy AST lint** over the ``merge/`` projection path. The
  FR-005 regression is ``merge/bookkeeping_projection.py`` blind-``write_bytes``-ing
  a *foreign* status/meta/trace source straight onto the *authoritative*
  target-surface artifact (event log / ``meta.json`` / ``traces/*.md``) instead of
  reconciling it (``_union_event_logs`` / rematerialize). The lint fires on that
  exact shape and stays silent on the fixed tree — including the deliberately
  *derived* ``status.json`` copy (line ``write_bytes(source_status_bytes)``), which
  is a rematerialized/degenerate view, not an authoritative both-sides-divergent
  artifact.

* **T013 — driver-registry-completeness lint** (the primary #2709 ``-X theirs``
  vector, blind to the projection lint). Two independent assertions:
    - **sync**: every driver DECLARED in the in-code registry
      (``specify_cli.lanes.merge._MERGE_DRIVERS``) is REGISTERED in root
      ``.gitattributes`` and vice-versa — catches *dropping* an existing
      ``.gitattributes`` driver line;
    - **completeness (non-tautology)**: every both-sides-divergent canonical
      ``kitty-specs/**`` artifact enumerated from the INDEPENDENT
      mission-artifact-kind registry (``mission_runtime.artifacts`` —
      ``MissionArtifactKind`` + ``_MISSION_FILE_KIND_BY_BASENAME`` /
      ``_COORD_RESIDUE_DIRS`` / ``kind_for_mission_file``), NOT enumerated from
      ``.gitattributes`` itself, carries a registered merge driver. Fail-closed: a
      *future* net-new canonical artifact re-inherits #2709 via ``-X theirs``
      unless it is a driver or is explicitly classified as non-divergent below.
